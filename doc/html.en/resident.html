<h1><a class="anchor" id="resident">Memory-Resident Plugins </a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" id="resident1">
What is a memory-resident plugin?</a></h2>
<p>Like its name suggests, a memory-resident plugin is a plugin that stays in memory throughout its life after loading, remaining active regardless of other running programs. Regular (non-resident memory) plugins initialize when they are called by a menu, etc, and then end immediately after running. In contrast, plugins that are memory-resident are initialized from the time that Shade starts, and stay resident in memory until Shade ends. This memory-residency allows functions (like callback functions) to operate on the fly according to user input. However, using memory-resident plugins excessively may cause Shade to run slow, so it is best to only use them when necessary.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="resident2">
Switching between resident and non-resident plugins</a></h2>
<p>To switch between a resident and non-resident plugin, set whether to return true or false in the global function (is_resident). If it returns true, then the plugin is a memory-resident plugin. There are two types of meaning in resident; one is the shared library type (called dll in Windows and dylib in Mac OSX), which gets loaded during Shade launches and unloads when the program is terminated. Another one is the create_interface, which creates a new interface (xxx_interface) by calling new and releases the interface by explicitly calling the delete operator.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="resident3">
Callback functions</a></h2>
<p>Callback functions are functions that call resident plugins when a prescribed action is carried out in Shade. For example, when users try to carry out the create, move or delete operation, then the plugin will get called by the callback function, so that the plugin can process according to those operations. It is also possible to have callback ability for the wireframe drawing in the figure window, which provides the plugin with real time display handling. However, if the process takes too long inside the callback function, it will slow down the overall performance of Shade. So please use it only when necessary. </p>
